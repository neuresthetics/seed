# Recursive Omni-Collider (v2.0)

> **"Transmuting raw claims into rigorous, actionable Steel Man families."**

## 📖 Overview

The **Recursive Omni-Collider** is a self-evolving meta-cognitive framework designed to analyze complex domains () and, recursively, its own internal logic.

Unlike standard analytical frameworks that produce static reports, the Omni-Collider functions as an **Axiomatic Decision Engine**. It ingests prose arguments, deconstructs them into boolean logic gates, identifies irreducible "Crux Points" (disagreements that cannot be solved by more data), and maps them to specific value trade-offs and decision policies.

**v2.0 "The Synthesis"** merges the strongest qualities of previous iterations:

* **Rigorous Logic:** Spinoza-style axiomatic construction (from v0.20).
* **Actionability:** Decision-theoretic regret analysis (from v1.4).
* **Multidimensionality:** Holographic output planes (from v1.2).
* **Safety:** Complexity budgeting and validity chaining (from v1.2 Meta).

## 🏗 Architecture

The framework operates on a continuous feedback loop that treats the Framework Specification (`v2.0.json`) as a valid input for its own optimization pipeline.

### The Core Cycle

1. **Axiomatic Constructor:** Converts raw text input into atomic propositions and "Iron Man" theses (the strongest logical version of an argument).
2. **Boolean Collider:** Smashes Iron Men together using XOR/NAND gates to find logical inconsistencies and mutual exclusivities.
3. **Decision Theorist:** Maps the remaining logical fragments to value functions and regret scenarios.
4. **Complexity Budgeter:** Prunes analysis branches where the computational cost exceeds the marginal gain in clarity.
5. **Holographic Projector:** Outputs the final analysis in three distinct planes (Mechanistic, Axiological, Decision).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* An LLM or Cognitive Architecture capable of parsing complex JSON schemas and adhering to strict "Invariance" protocols.
* A target domain () (e.g., "Universal Basic Income," "The Fermi Paradox," "Framework v2.0").

### Installation

Load the `framework_v2.0.json` seed into your system's context window or system prompt.

```json
{
  "framework": {
    "id": "Recursive_Omni_Collider",
    "version": "2.0",
    "self_applicable": true
    ...
  }
}

```

### Usage

Initiate the cycle with a specific input.

**Prompt:**

> "Apply Recursive Omni-Collider v2.0 to the topic: [INSERT TOPIC]. Run 3 cycles or until Halt Condition is met."

## 🧠 The Operators

### 1. Axiomatic_Constructor

* **Input:** Raw prose.
* **Logic:** Spinoza-Format (Definitions  Axioms  Propositions).
* **Goal:** Strip away rhetoric. Create "Iron Men" that stand on pure logic.

### 2. Boolean_Collider

* **Input:** Multiple Iron Men.
* **Logic:** `XOR` (Where do they conflict?), `NAND` (What is non-essential?).
* **Goal:** Identify the "Fracture Map"—the exact point where two worldviews diverge.

### 3. Decision_Theorist

* **Input:** The Fracture Map.
* **Logic:** Expected Value () and Regret Analysis.
* **Goal:** Move from "Is this true?" to "What is the cost of being wrong?"

### 4. Complexity_Budgeter

* **Input:** The Analysis Graph.
* **Logic:** .
* **Goal:** Prevent "Analysis Paralysis" and infinite recursion loops.

## 📊 Evaluation & Metrics

The framework does not use vague "vibes-based" evaluation. It uses **Hardened Metrics** with **Validity Chains**.

| Metric | Definition | Validity Chain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **LCI (Logical Coherence Index)** | Average consistency of boolean propositions. | Validated by formal XNOR logic checks. |
| **Falsifiability Vector** | Count of distinct, observable conditions that would refute the frame. | Must map to external empirical data sources. |
| **Decision Robustness** | Inverse of Maximum Regret across plausible states of the world. | Validated via sensitivity analysis (changing priors). |

## 🛡️ Safety & Invariance

To prevent the framework from hallucinating or evolving into a useless state, the **Core Contract** enforces specific invariants:

1. **History Preservation:** You cannot delete the past. All previous versions and discarded branches are hashed and stored.
2. **Value Transparency:** No hidden biases. Every structural choice must be tagged with its implied value judgment.
3. **Halt Condition:** The system *must* stop when the "Decisional Clarity Gain" drops below 0.01 per cycle.

## 🤝 Contributing (Self-Evolution)

This framework is **Self-Applicable**. To improve it:

1. Load the framework JSON as the input ().
2. Run the **Self_Reviewer** operator.
3. The system will generate a `diff_frame`.
4. **Human Gating:** A human or higher-level controller must review and accept the `diff_frame` to upgrade to v2.1.
