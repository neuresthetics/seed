# 🌿 **seed**

![seed](https://github.com/neuresthetics/seed/blob/main/img/seed.png)

**An Aristotelian entelechy program — copy, paste, or drop.**

Seed is a **recursive cognitive kernel**: a small, declarative program that can be fed into itself or combined with any other subject to generate a specialized reasoning engine for that domain. It is the minimal unit of the Neuresthetics cognitive architecture — the part that grows the rest.

You can:

- feed Seed into itself to produce a stronger version of Seed  
- feed Seed into any topic to produce a specialized framework for that topic  
- chain versions (0.1 → 0.2 → 0.3…) to grow modular extensions  
- use the collider process to generate new operators, modules, or pipelines  

Seed builds itself around whatever you give it.

**Examples:**

```
Feed seed into itself → stronger seed
Feed seed + stock trading → trading-hardening engine
Feed seed + 3D DNA analysis → genomic reasoning engine
Feed seed + Riemann hypothesis → mathematical collider
```

Seed transforms development from **craft** (experience-based) into **computational science** (algorithmically improvable). You’re not writing prompts — you’re cultivating logical ecosystems that self-optimize through recursive, reality-grounded collisions.

# 🧠 **What Seed Is**

Seed is a **150‑line declarative program** written in JSON.  
It acts as:

- a **recursive reasoning kernel**  
- a **steel‑man generator**  
- a **logic‑gate interpreter**  
- a **Spinoza‑style geometric engine**  
- a **self‑refining metaprogram**  

The LLM is the runtime.  
The JSON is the AST.  
The prompt is the program.

Seed is the smallest unit that can grow a full cognitive system.

# ⚙️ **How It Works**

![seed placeholder](https://github.com/neuresthetics/seed/blob/main/img1/flow.png)

Seed operates through six recursive stages:

1. **Steel‑Manning (Pre‑Entry)**  
   Negates flaws, strengthens the proposition, establishes axioms.

2. **Collider Entry**  
   Creates two lanes: the proposition and its strongest inversion.

3. **Destructive Smashing (XOR Event)**  
   Exposes contradictions and irreducible differences.

4. **Fragment Reconstruction (NAND/NOR)**  
   Rebuilds new structures from the logical debris.

5. **Meta‑Recursion**  
   Feeds the output back into the system until coherence stabilizes.

6. **Invariant Extraction (XNOR)**  
   Identifies what remains true across all collisions.

The halting condition is a **coherence delta < 0.01**.

This ensures recursion accelerates refinement without diverging.

# 🧩 **Why It Works**

Seed combines:

- **Boolean functional completeness** (NAND/NOR)  
- **Spinoza’s geometric method** (axioms → propositions → deductions)  
- **Hegelian dialectics** (thesis ↔ antithesis → synthesis)  
- **Recursive self‑improvement** (RSI analogy, but bounded)  
- **Declarative programming** (JSON as AST)  

It is a **computational dialectic engine** — a machine that evolves arguments, frameworks, and reasoning structures toward invariant truth.

# 🔁 **Versioning Philosophy**

Seed is intentionally small.  
It is rebuilt often.
If this was ever widely used, version control would need to be blockchain, because there are N v0.0.  
It is designed to be fed into itself.

The current version is the result of:

- hundreds of self‑collisions  
- dozens of domain‑specific applications  
- repeated compression cycles  

Seed is not a static artifact — it is a **living kernel**.

# 🧨 **What Seed Enables (User Capabilities)**

Seed gives you abilities you don’t normally have:

| Capability | What It Enables |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Automated steel‑manning** | Generate the strongest version of any idea |
| **Argument collision** | Smash ideas together to expose contradictions |
| **Invariant extraction** | Identify what remains true across all versions |
| **Recursive self‑refinement** | Improve the framework by feeding it into itself |
| **Bounded RSI** | Accelerate reasoning without infinite loops |
| **Reality‑gate reasoning** | Use AND/OR/XOR/NAND/NOR as metaphysical operators |
| **First‑principles reconstruction** | Rebuild broken ideas from universal gates |
| **Coherence scoring** | Quantify internal consistency (XNOR) |
| **Dialectical synthesis** | Resolve paradoxes by finding the invariant third term |
| **Universal applicability** | Apply the same kernel to math, biology, finance, philosophy |

Seed turns you into a **truth experimentalist** — someone who runs structured, recursive experiments on ideas to discover what survives.

# 🧬 **Why Seed Exists**

After building dozens of domain‑specific frameworks, the pattern became obvious:

> “I rebuilt the same structure 100 times.  
> I needed a program that could rebuild itself.”

Seed is that program.

To use it, just copy-paste it into your LLM project files, or as an accompanying prompt item.
