## 🌟 Overview

The **Recursive Steel Man Collider (RSMC)** is a meta-cognitive framework designed to analyze complex domains through recursive self-improvement. It systematically builds the strongest possible versions of competing positions, identifies irreducible disagreements, and connects analyses to concrete decisions—all while maintaining ethical alignment and managing complexity.

Born from 8 evolutionary cycles of self-application, v2.0 represents the synthesis of multiple framework versions into a unified, maximally-capable system.

## 🎯 Core Purpose

**To generate maximally rigorous, falsifiable, and actionable analyses of complex domains (X) through recursive self-improvement, maintaining ethical constraints while optimizing for explanatory depth, evaluation power, and practical applicability.**

## 🚀 Key Features

| Feature | Description | Benefit |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Holographic Projection** | Analyzes across 4 planes: Mechanistic, Normative, Epistemic, Decision-Theoretic | Comprehensive, multi-dimensional understanding |
| **Recursive Self-Improvement** | Framework can analyze and evolve its own structure | Continuously improves clarity, safety, and capability |
| **Decision Theory Integration** | Calculates expected value, regret, and option value | Connects philosophical positions to concrete actions |
| **Falsifiability Mandate** | Every position must define observable conditions that would invalidate it | Ensures scientific rigor and testability |
| **Complexity Budgeting** | Utility gains must outpace complexity increases | Prevents over-engineering and maintains usability |
| **Ethical Alignment Tracking** | Explicit value trade-offs and ethical constraint adherence | Maintains alignment with human values |
| **Applicability Mapping** | Framework knows its own strengths and limitations | Prevents misapplication and guides adaptation |

### **Core Components:**

1. **Operators**: 12 specialized functions (Constructor, Collider, Decision Analyzer, etc.)
2. **Projection Planes**: 4-dimensional analysis framework
3. **Evaluation System**: Dual-layer metrics (domain + framework) with validity chains
4. **Recursion Control**: Smart depth limiting with human oversight triggers
5. **Meta-Structures**: Specialized frame types for capturing different aspects of reasoning

## 🔧 Quick Start

### Basic Usage Pattern:

```python
# Pseudocode example
from steelman_collider import RecursiveSteelManCollider

# Initialize framework
framework = RecursiveSteelManCollider(version="2.0")

# Analyze a complex domain
domain = "Should society prioritize economic growth or environmental sustainability?"
result = framework.analyze(domain, cycles=3)

# Access multi-dimensional results
print(result.mechanistic_view)    # Causal analysis
print(result.normative_view)      # Value trade-offs
print(result.epistemic_view)      # Uncertainty mapping
print(result.decision_view)       # Action recommendations

# Get steel man families
steel_men = result.steelman_family
for branch in steel_men:
    print(f"Position: {branch.position}")
    print(f"Trade-offs: {branch.tradeoffs}")
    print(f"Testable Implications: {branch.falsifiability_vector}")
```

### Installation (Conceptual):

```bash
# Since this is a conceptual framework, "installation" means understanding and implementing
# the architecture in your reasoning process or software system

1. Study the framework specification (this README + JSON spec)
2. Implement core operators for your domain
3. Configure evaluation metrics
4. Set recursion limits based on problem complexity
5. Integrate with your decision-making workflow
```

## 🎨 Projection Planes

The framework analyzes every domain through four interconnected lenses:

### 1. **Mechanistic Plane**
- *Focus*: Causal structure, mechanisms, dependencies
- *Output*: Causal graphs, structural invariants
- *Question answered*: "How does it work?"

### 2. **Normative Plane**
- *Focus*: Values, ethics, stakeholder impacts
- *Output*: Value trade-offs, ethical constraints
- *Question answered*: "What should we value?"

### 3. **Epistemic Plane**
- *Focus*: Knowledge, uncertainty, evidence
- *Output*: Confidence intervals, evidence weights
- *Question answered*: "How confident can we be?"

### 4. **Decision-Theoretic Plane**
- *Focus*: Actions, outcomes, expected value
- *Output*: Policy recommendations, regret analysis
- *Question answered*: "What should we do?"

## 📊 Evaluation System

### Domain Metrics:
- **Logical Coherence Index**: Measures internal consistency
- **Falsifiability Score**: Counts testable implications
- **Decision Resolution Score**: Assesses decision quality under uncertainty
- **Explanatory Depth**: Measures multi-layer understanding
- **Trade-off Transparency**: Tracks value conflict explicitness

### Framework Metrics:
- **Framework Clarity**: Term definition quality
- **Ethical Alignment**: Value adherence and harm prevention
- **Complexity/Utility Ratio**: Ensures gains outpace complexity
- **Change Traceability**: Tracks evolution with justification
- **Applicability Accuracy**: Framework self-knowledge

## 🔄 Recursion Control

The framework intelligently manages its own evolution:

```yaml
Base Cycle: For standard problems (4 phases, ~30 minutes)
Extended Cycle: For complex/high-stakes problems (+3 phases)

Recursion Limits:
- Max depth: 8 self-application cycles
- Human review: Required after cycle 4
- Auto-halt: When improvements < thresholds

Safety Triggers:
- Ethical alignment < 0.9
- Complexity/utility ratio < 0.7
- High-risk modification detected
```

## 🎯 When to Use This Framework

### **Well-Suited For:**
- Complex multi-stakeholder decisions
- Policy analysis and strategic planning
- Philosophical and conceptual analysis
- Ethical dilemma resolution
- Research methodology design
- Long-term forecasting under uncertainty

### **Poorly-Suited For:**
- Time-critical emergency decisions
- Simple binary classification problems
- Domains with no uncertainty or value conflicts
- Situations requiring purely intuitive responses
- Users needing simple yes/no answers without nuance

## 📚 Examples

### Example 1: Climate Policy Analysis
```python
domain = "Should we implement a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system?"

result = framework.analyze(domain, cycles=4)

# Get the steel man families
pro_tax = result.steelman_family[0]      # Strongest case for carbon tax
pro_cap = result.steelman_family[1]      # Strongest case for cap-and-trade
hybrid = result.steelman_family[2]       # Strongest hybrid approach

# Examine crux points
for crux in result.crux_points:
    print(f"Disagreement: {crux.issue}")
    print(f"Test: {crux.testable_implication}")
    print(f"Expected value difference: {crux.ev_difference}")
```

### Example 2: Self-Improvement (Meta)
```python
# Apply framework to itself
self_analysis = framework.self_review()

# See proposed improvements
for diff in self_analysis.diff_frames:
    print(f"Change: {diff.description}")
    print(f"Justification: {diff.rationale}")
    print(f"Expected improvement: {diff.expected_impact}")
    
# Adopt improvements selectively
framework.adopt_diffs(self_analysis.diff_frames[:3])  # Top 3 improvements
```

## 🛡️ Safety & Ethics

The framework includes multiple safety mechanisms:

1. **Ethical Alignment Scoring**: Every modification evaluated for value alignment
2. **Harm Potential Assessment**: Simulates potential negative consequences
3. **Human Oversight**: Critical changes require human approval
4. **Complexity Budgeting**: Prevents runaway sophistication
5. **Applicability Warnings**: Alerts when framework is misapplied

## 🔮 Evolution & Roadmap

The framework is designed to evolve. Current priorities:

1. **Short-term (v2.1)**: 
   - Add more operator examples
   - Create interactive visualization tools
   - Develop domain-specific templates

2. **Medium-term (v2.5)**:
   - Implement automated validity chain checking
   - Add collaborative multi-user mode
   - Integrate with existing reasoning tools

3. **Long-term (v3.0)**:
   - Develop self-optimizing architecture
   - Create natural language interface
   - Implement real-time adaptation to user expertise

## 🤝 Contributing

1. **Apply the framework** to new domains and share results
2. **Identify weaknesses** in the current specification
3. **Propose diff_frames** with clear justifications
4. **Test boundary cases** and report findings
5. **Create implementations** in different programming languages
